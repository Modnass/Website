			<p class="content-text"> Rite of passage is the step into the unknown - <br> A world of mystery and imagination, of horror and bliss, the confrontation with the unthinkable and the transformation into a new existence. <br><br> Join us on the Heroes Journey into the abyss of
				our collective consciousness and find that your own story is but the story of us all. <br> Rite of passage - the price of a new life is the loss of your old.<br><br><br> Rite of Passage is Finn Meiers first Solo Show at the Functional Art Gallery

			<p class="content-text">The Whole Project was autobiographic as well as trying to reflect on archetypical ideas, that everyone can relate to. <br><br> As my personal Rite of passage this project was my graduation from art university and marked the beginning of a new chapter
				in my life. The Project is based on the Book "The Hero with a thousand faces" by Joseph Campbell (1949, Pantheon Books) In which Campbell describes the blueprint for mythology and legend which we relate to on a deep level and find in contemporary
				stories like "Star Wars" or "Harry Potter"
				<br><br> Rite of passage is a journey to these Roots of narration by expressing it through contemporary form and material.
