				<!-- About<br><br> -->

	<p class="text">		Meier’s practice revolves around the concept of exploring the subconsious.
In a previous series of works, MATERIAL NIGHTMARE, he took a look at the
collective subconsious of material associations and “good taste”. He created
pieces challenging this collective consience of what should be done, or rather
what should not be done. By associating radically different materials and creating
a high/low confrontation, he asks the user to question the boundaries and the
relevance of taste.
<br>
In this new series, DREAMS, Meier documented his dreams for an extended period
of time. He then analysed those very personal subconsious messages and gave
them physical forms. Doing so, he explores and questions the reality of his own
existence, while crafting elaborate tales in the physical incarnation that are his designs.
