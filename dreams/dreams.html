<p class="content-text"> Dreams is a journey in my own world of images, symbols and imagination.
Recording my dreams i looked for similarities, patterns, images and relations
between them. The Dreams series shows the three different layers of dreaming.
Deep, Portal and Light.<br>
I started with collages, to catch a feeling and working from that point on forward.</p><br><br><br><br>

<p  class="content-text">Deep is a materialisation of the archaic, dark and deep dreams that strike us
with meaning and fear of the unknown. Made from massive burned oak, put on seven
rusted steel pipes and doused with tar.

          Portal describes the everchanging surroundings of a dream. We leave a
				birthday party, turn our head once and are in a scene of pursuit.
				Portal is that threshold between one and the other. The room without
				walls, the invisible doorway. Stainless titanium coated steel, wood,
				rubble, PU-foam.

          Light shows the immateriality of dreams. Sometimes weâ€™re not sure if
				something is real or not, if we are actually dreaming or if we are awake.
				What kind of material is that? Can I touch it? Using a holographic effect
				Light is exploring the boundaries of understanding.
				Stainless steel, dichroic film, neonlight, mirror, fresnel lense.
